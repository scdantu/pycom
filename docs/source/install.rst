Install
=======

You can easily install PyCoM using pip from the source code on `github respository <https://github.com/scdantu/pycom>`_. 


Using pip
---------


.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install git+https://github.com/scdantu/pycom
    
    
Differences
-----------

   You can work with PyCoMdb in three different modes:
      #. *PyCoM (local)*: Download the database to your computer and use PyCoM.
      #. *PyCoM (remote)*: Work with the database on PyCoM server using PyCoM.
      #. *WebAPI*: Work with the WebAPI without using PyCoM. 

Using PyCoM (local) allows access to all the functional features, while PyCoM (remote) and the WebAPI has some limitations as shown in the table below:
